This page shall contain a brief description of all ongoing student projects.If you are a student looking for undertaking a project with me, please familiarize yourself with the current projects listed on this page.

I also prepared a small presentation on doing projects [[Project Advice](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1tea4bpsd0fekd/project_advice.pdf?dl=1 "Project Advice")]. The presentation is a gentle summary of all the information present on this page.

Before I associate myself with a project, I usually look at the beautiful guideline given by Prof. Richard Feynman.

> The principle of science, the definition, almost, is the following: the test if all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of scientific “truth”. But what is the source of knowledge? Where do the laws that are to be tested come from? Experiment, itself, helps to produce these laws, in the sense that it gives us hints.
> 
> But also needed is the imagination to create from these hints the great generalizations – to guess at the wonderful, simple, but very strange patterns beneath them all, and then to experiment more to check again whether we have made the right guess.
> 
> Richard Feynman

**A brief summary of the ongoing projects is provided here.**

**Transport Networks** Provide search service for travelers using multi-modal transport service. Here, multi-modal mean multiple means of transport, say, train, bus, flight, boat etc. In order to provide the multi-modal transport search service, the first step is to collect schedules of transport operators. The second step is to develop algorithms that would dynamically search the given schedules for a source-destination pair. The final step is to develop web application that would provide search service to interested travelers.  
GitHub repositories containing relevant code are: [Transport Scheduler](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/TransportScheduler), [MMTP Schedule Generator](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/Generic-MMTP).

**&nbsp;Social Networks** Scrape/Observe online social network  
structure using IRC chat logs,&nbsp;mailing lists etc. We wish to deduce communication patterns in these online platforms, and also explain the multiplex nature of online social networks. Determining multiplex network structure would provide baseline input to normative discussion on optimal structures of multiplex networks. GitHub repositories containing relevant code are: [IRC Log Parser](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/IRCLogParser), [MailingListParser](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/MailingListParser), [NetworkSIMS](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/NetworkSIMS).

**Protocol Analysis** &nbsp;We are interested in developing tools for sound network measurements. We are developing a tool to perform custom packet analysis.GitHub repository containing relevant code is: [BITS-Darshini](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/BITS-Darshini).

**Autolab** &nbsp;An automated evaluation platform for programming labs. The software is capable of utilizing different testing strategies (unit, integration, functional tests and I/O tests are supported). GitHub repository containing relevant code is: [JavaAutolab](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/JavaAutolab).

**Network Measurements** &nbsp;We performed&nbsp;India-specific analysis of Internet structure by sampling the looking glass data provided by NIXI. A standalone desktop application was developed to visualize the BGP protocol advertisements seen on NIXI IXP platforms. We call it ISPView; You can [download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/miv96rejesop5gm/AAC9e60sVU4XIyo2kW0ZF7gJa?dl=0) and play with the application. GitHub repository containing relevant code is: [ISPView](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/ISPView).  
Previously we worked on the analysis and visualisation of large network measurement data sets available with data providers such as Route Views, RIPE, NIXI, M-Labs etc.  
One project in this area is focused on analysis and visualization of BGP protocol advertisements archived by Route Views project. GitHub repository containing relevant code is:&nbsp;[ASTopology](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/ASTopology). The snapshots and timelapse developed as part of this project are [available for download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nmuqt04obmxglkn/AABwKDgEZYAQmSoLG46SobYia?dl=0).  
We also analyze India-specific measurement data available in M-labs data sets. Work done in this area and the preliminary results are available in [NDT](https://github.com/prasadtalasila/NDT) GitHub repository.

If you are a on-campus CS student and are interested in working on one of these projects, please send an e-mail to tsrkp AT goa DOT bits-pilani DOT ac DOT in. Please clearly mention the project that you are interested in.
