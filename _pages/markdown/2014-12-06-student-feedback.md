- Having worked in different situations, this [Internetworking Technologies] course is one of the closest to actual work in the industry and in research and is highly useful to students who wish to be involved in this field.
- I took Internetworking Technologies as an elective in 4-1. Apart from an interesting course structure, the course was handled really professionally. The best thing about the course was its stress on various upcoming technologies and data center architectures. There was a lot of emphasis on applying the theory learnt in practical scenarios, through interactive assignments. The course also involved study of research papers in contemporary field , which in itself was a learning experience.&nbsp; All in all, it was a great course, though it requires a certain amount of effort by the student.
