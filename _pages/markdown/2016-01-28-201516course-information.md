**Course Description:**

The internetworking technologies course covers the architectural aspects of the existing and experimental networks. The aim is to understand the process of developing the network architecture in order to apply the lessons in the development of new network architectures. The course reviews the Internet architecture and immediately focuses on the content delivery networks (CDN). The other architectures covered in this course are: P2P networks, delay-tolerant networks, data centers and Internet exchange points. The protocol stack of the Internet is also covered in-detail to enhance the understanding of the architectural principles.

Measurement is a foundation on which scientific and engineering observation, and hence scientific deduction stands. For this reason, basic principles of network measurement are also covered in the course.
