<p>My doctoral research is in the broad area of <em>Network Science.</em> My work is focused on structural transformations of multidimentional (multiplex) networks. In simple terms, I am interested in mathematical transformations of graphs with multiple edges between vertices. This research has applications in the domains of virtual networks, multi-modal transportation systems, and online social networks.</p>
<p>Interested readers can go through my doctoral <a title="Proposal" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4fb1ep5h8pmz4q/proposal.pdf?dl=1" target="_blank">proposal</a>. Research results of ongoing work are available on <a title="Publications" href="http://prasadtalasila.wordpress.com/publications/">Publications</a> page.</p>
<p>I also work with students in the areas of network measurements, transport networks and social networks. Details of these student projects are available on <a title="Projects" href="http://prasadtalasila.wordpress.com/research/projects/">Projects</a> page. Code for most of these projects is hosted on <a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/prasadtalasila" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
