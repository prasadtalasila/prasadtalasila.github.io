My current research work is in the area of Cyber Physical Systems. I am part of [DIGIT center](https://digit.au.dk/) at Aarhus University. [HUBCAP](https://www.hubcap.eu/) and [DIGITbrain](https://digit.au.dk/research-projects/digitbrain/) are the two projects that I participate in.

During 2018-20, I worked in the area of storage compression in distributed Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

My doctoral research is in the broad area of _Network Science._ My work is focused on structural transformations of multidimentional (multiplex) networks. In simple terms, I am interested in mathematical transformations of graphs with multiple edges between vertices. This research has applications in the domains of virtual networks, multi-modal transportation systems, and online social networks.

Research results of the prior and ongoing work are available on [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications) page.

Previously, I worked with students in the areas of network measurements, transport networks and social networks. Details of these student projects are available on [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/projects) page. Code for most of these projects is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/prasadtalasila).
