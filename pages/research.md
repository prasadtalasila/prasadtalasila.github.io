My doctoral research is in the broad area of _Network Science._ My work is focused on structural transformations of multidimentional (multiplex) networks. In simple terms, I am interested in mathematical transformations of graphs with multiple edges between vertices. This research has applications in the domains of virtual networks, multi-modal transportation systems, and online social networks.

Interested readers can go through my doctoral [proposal](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4fb1ep5h8pmz4q/proposal.pdf?dl=1 "Proposal"). Research results of ongoing work are available on [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications) page.

I also work with students in the areas of network measurements, transport networks and social networks. Details of these student projects are available on [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/projects) page. Code for most of these projects is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/prasadtalasila).
