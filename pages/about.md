Welcome to the home page of Prasad Talasila. I am working [Prof. Peter Gorm Larsen](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/peter-gorm-larsen(318d787b-3528-4a49-88be-60491de69409).html), Aarhus University as postdoctorate researcher in the Cyber Physical Systems Group. The [Research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research) and [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications) pages contain more relevant information on research, publications and data sets.

Previously I worked with [Prof. Daniel Lucani](http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/id(c4e78b1e-4dd6-460f-9c44-1a44771ce01a).html) as postdoctorate researcher in the Communications Group of Aarhus University (2018-2020).
