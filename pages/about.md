Welcome to the home page of Prasad Talasila. I am working as postdoctorate researcher in the Communications Group of Aarhus University. I work with Prof. [Daniel Lucani](http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/id&#40;c4e78b1e-4dd6-460f-9c44-1a44771ce01a&#41;.html) at Aarhus University. The [Research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research) and [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications) pages contain more relevant information on research, publications and data sets.

Previously I worked as Assistant Professor in the [Department of CS&IS](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ComputerScienceInformationsSystems/ComputerScienceandInformationSystems), BITS Pilani - KK Birla Goa Campus, India (2012-2018). Before that, I worked as Assistant Professor in the [Department of CSE](http://cse.rvrjc.ac.in), RVR&JC College of Engineering, Guntur, India. The courses that I handled are available under [Courses]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses) section.
A snapshot of my professional life is available in two versions of Resume, [brief](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e0icc252kaoowwj/resume-brief.pdf?dl=1) and [detailed](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yr4x4mewzwr9lie/resume.pdf?dl=1). I also happen to enjoy half-marathons. More details on running experiences are available on [Marathons]({{ site.baseurl }}/marathons) page.
