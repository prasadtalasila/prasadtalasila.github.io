Welcome to the home page of Prasad Talasila. I am pursuing doctoral studies in the area of Network Science. The [Research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research) and [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications) pages contain more relevant information on research, publications and data sets.

I also work as Lecturer n the Department of CS&IS, BITS, Pilani - KK Birla Goa Campus. The courses that I handle are available under [Courses]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses) section.
A snapshot of my professional life is available on [Resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5jkpixz0kqahwgz/resume_aug_2017.pdf?dl=1) page. I also happen to enjoy half-marathons. More details on running experiences are available on [Marathons]({{ site.baseurl }}/marathons) page.

Some of my short articles, lecture notes and lab manuals are available for download. These materials are available in [Writings]({{ site.baseurl }}/writings) section.

My impromptu ramblings, if any, are filed in the [Blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog). Please see the [Contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) page for various ways of getting in touch with me.
