<p><strong>Do your own thing</strong></p>
<p>Recently I attended a social gathering. On that occasion, I had the good fortune of being a participant in a discussion on student choice. One senior academician exhorted the need for <em>freedom in academic institutions, able to do your own thing in life and making most of available opportunities</em>. Given that these are the three things that I myself try to impress students with, the conversation got me thinking. The senior academician was eloquent in his verbal expressions on the topics stated and seems to have made some impression on the student participants of this social conversation.</p>
<p>Along the way, a few students raised the tried and true defenses against <em>do your own thing</em> line of argument. Some of the arguments like family pressure, social status and privileged life seem so real. The senior academician lent a patient ear to the student arguments; he still persisted with <em>do your own thing</em> line of arguement. I was silent till then; Being true to my argumentative nature, I interjected the senior academicians' argument by saying, "You are sounding like Roger Federer saying playing Tennis is easy."  I further elaborated that this senior academician and myself have good, supportive families and are rather lucky in that respect. His retort was, "Well then, make the most of it."</p>
<p>This whole conversation got me thinking on the role of luck and freedom in my life. Freedom being easy to tackle, I will dispense with it first.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom and Mythology</strong></p>
<p>Dad always told me that I was stubbornly free minded individual. I did make disastrous choices in life multiple times. As they say, you got experience if you did not get what you want. The freedom of thoughts, which acts as the fountainhead of other forms of freedom, is the most cherished one of all. Given that so much of blood was spilled in the name of freedom of thought in the history, may be the society cares about the freedom of thought too. Funny thing about freedom of thoughts is that it is by definition a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>Still, our personal and societal habits get me thinking about the barriers that each of us erect to live in self-imposed jails. Each jail is a persona we create for ourselves. We emphatically call this character.</p>
<p>Mythology seems to be a great cure for such loss of freedom. I benefited enormously from mythology. I can profusely thank Joseph Campbell and Karen Armstrong for getting me excited about mythology. The myths we live by greatly affect our perspectives on freedom, luck, customs, relationships etc. The myths BITS students live by are the purported lives of Steve Wozniack, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs etc. I am not really sure if these myths are good enough to live a rich life.</p>
